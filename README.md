# Description

**Launchtime** is a multi-platform application allowing the Novation Launchpad
hardware to be used as standalone a step-sequencer synchronized with any
MIDI-enabled host software (DAW).

# Compilation

In order to compile **Launchtime**, the Qt4 library is required.
After the Qt4 framework is installed, run the following commands:
```
$ qmake
$ make
```

# Usage

The **Launchtime** app provides a simple graphical user interface allowing to
connect to a Novation Launchpad device and to specify a name for the virtual MIDI port.

# Notes

Launchtime uses the RtMidi library to perform MIDI I/O operations, and most
notably opening virtual MIDI ports to communication with MIDI hosts.
For now, only the MacOSX and Linux platforms support this feature.
